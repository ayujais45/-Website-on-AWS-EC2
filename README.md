# 🌐 AWS EC2 Website Deployment — Internship Project

This repository showcases my Cloud Computing internship project, where I deployed a fully functional static website using an **Amazon EC2 Linux instance**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This website was created and hosted as part of my Cloud Computing internship to demonstrate the ability to:

- Launch and manage a Linux EC2 instance
- Install and configure Apache web server
- Write and organize HTML and CSS files
- Serve a static website on the public internet using AWS infrastructure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Amazon EC2 (Amazon Linux)**
- **Apache HTTP Server**
- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **SCP for file transfer**
- **SSH for remote access**

## 🖥️ Hosted On

- Public IP (Changes if instance is stopped/restarted)

⚠️ Note: You may need to update the public IP in the browser after restarting the EC2 instance.
