Deployed a static website using HTML/CSS on an Amazon EC2 Linux instance as part of a Cloud Computing internship. Configured Apache server, connected via SSH, and hosted the project live on the internet.
# 🌐 AWS EC2 Website Deployment — Internship Project

This repository showcases my Cloud Computing internship project, where I deployed a fully functional static website using an **Amazon EC2 Linux instance**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This website was created and hosted as part of my Cloud Computing internship to demonstrate the ability to:

- Launch and manage a Linux EC2 instance
- Install and configure Apache web server
- Write and organize HTML and CSS files
- Serve a static website on the public internet using AWS infrastructure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Amazon EC2 (Amazon Linux)**
