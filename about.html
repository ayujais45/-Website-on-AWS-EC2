    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Ayushi Jaiswal</strong>, a passionate and curious learner currently exploring the world of cloud computing, web development, and real-world project deployment.</p>
    
    <p>Through this internship, I’ve built and hosted a website on Amazon EC2 — learning how to configure servers, write clean HTML/CSS, and manage a live environment. I love turning ideas into actual working solutions and believe in learning by doing!</p>
    
    <p>This project is just the beginning — I'm excited to continue building smarter, more impactful digital experiences.</p>
